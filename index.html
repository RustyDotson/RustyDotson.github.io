		SPFFH is a hybrid of two models on the concept of self-organized criticality,
		a physics model that is used to represent models that progress consistently
		until a certain variable becomes what is called a critical point. After one
		piece of the entire structure reaches a critical point, it creates an
		"avalanche-like" effect that topples over to other surrounding variables.
	</p>
	<p class="paraOutline">
		For example, a sandpile with grains of sand being poured consistently
		on it is a typical example of self-organized criticality. It slowly builds
		up until it reaches a point to where an avalanche (a drastic change of
		events) must occur for the physical system to maintain equilibrium.
		A forest fire is another good example, where a forest gradually grows in
		size until the chance of a strike of lightning hitting a tree in the area
		becomes probable. Once lighting successfully strikes, the result will be a
		fire spreading throughout the forest and burning a large chain of trees.
	</p>
	<p class="paraOutline">
		SPFFH stands for Sand Pile Forest Fire Hybrid, and vizualizes a fusion
		of the two models. It takes the aspect on analog value as represented in the
		 depth of a sandpile, and a critical point resulting in the instant change between
		a node being dead or alive as represented in the forest fire model. After
		making these changes it presents a new model that makes use of the rules
		that are present within self-organized criticality.

		running in a browser, so the speed of the function here will defnintely
		not be as quick as desired. To view the original repo, go here:
