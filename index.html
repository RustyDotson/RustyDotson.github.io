	<p class="paraOutline">
		My name is Rusty, and I was born and raised in a coalmine town called Hurley, Virginia. My father was a coal miner, 
		and so were many others in the area at the time. Early on, life wasn't too great, and my family didn't have a lot of money 
		to spend on leisurely activities, or even on necessities at times. In my parents' eyes for most of my childhood, 
		college wasn't an option I had. I struggled to speak basic sentences until I was 5, so what chances did I have of being 
		successful in the realm of education?
	</p>
	<p class="paraOutline">
		When I was older, I was determined to become more than what people thought of me. I worked hard 
		to obtain scholarship money, attended dual-enrollment classes, and applied to multiple universities and colleges. 
		I felt that I shouldn't have to follow the footsteps of my ancestors, and instead wanted to invest my time 
		into computer science. My hard work paid off, and I was admitted to Berea College from 2016-2020.
	</p>
	<p class="paraOutline">
		Berea College is a liberal arts school, and students are expected to invest much of their time into subjects 
		outside of their major. On top of that, all students must work a part-time job on campus, which helps pay for tuition. 
	</p>
		
	<p><b>NO STUDENTS PAY FOR TUITION AT BEREA COLLEGE</b></p>
	
	<p class="paraOutline">
		Even though I studied computer science, I also put many hours into 
		learning about art, 
		history, languages, writing, religions, and cultures. As you can see in my header toolbar, there is an Artworks 
		page. many of those works are directly from one of my art classes at Berea. However, I saw the frustration in myself and many other 
		students during my time in college. "Why do I have to learn about art when all I want to do after college is code?!?!," 
		many students would question. On top of that, the time spent in these other classes took time away from students' majors, 
		which caused them to be academically behind students in their field of study from other colleges. 
	</p>
	<p class="paraOutline">
		The students' questions are valid; Why should I learn about vanishing points when I could invest that time into learning 
		all about red-black binary search trees? The amount of time I invested into some of my drawings would be enough time to fully 
		comprehend the N=NP problem (The time I spent on some of the drawings I worked on felt like I could prove N=NP in less time). 
		The answer is that my life shouldn't solely be about coding, and my time in college helped me branch out into other topics 
		that had potential to stick with me for life. The things I learned from these classes are things that I probably wouldn't 
		have learned any other way. In fact, some of the things I learned completely changed my future.
	</p>
	<p class="paraOutline">
		I took Japanese language classes during my first 2 years of college, and I fell in love with learning the language. I decided 
		to study abroad in Japan during the summer of 2018, and became interested in pursuing a minor in Asian Studies (originally 
		I had planned to pursue a minor in either music or mathematics). Afterwards, I studied Japanese history and religion, and Chinese 
		language. With my knowledge of Asian studies continuously growing, I was requested by one of my professors to apply for the 
		JET Programme. The JET Programme is a cultural exchange program for teaching English in Japanese public schools. It was a 
		tough decision between continuing my life as a programmer, or move to Japan to experience a different life. I desperately 
		wanted to experience life abroad and realized that the opportunity to move to Japan was rare, so I decided to go.
	</p>
	<p class="paraOutline">
		Now I currently live in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. A beautiful area filled with mountains and broad ricefields. When I am going 
		on hikes, the mountains remind me of my Appalachian home in many ways. When I get out of the mountains, I'm introduced to ricefields, 
		flatlands, and urban streets. I will not live in Niigata forever, but I'm not sure where I want to go after I am finished here. 
		Preferably, I would like to continue my programming career either in Tokyo, Osaka, or Europe.

	<div class="outline"><font size="7">SPFFH</font></div>

	<p class="paraOutline">
		SPFFH is a hybrid of two models on the concept of self-organized criticality,
		a physics model that is used to represent models that progress consistently
		until a certain variable becomes what is called a critical point. After one
		piece of the entire structure reaches a critical point, it creates an
		"avalanche-like" effect that topples over to other surrounding variables.
	</p>
	<p class="paraOutline">
		For example, a sandpile with grains of sand being poured consistently
		on it is a typical example of self-organized criticality. It slowly builds
		up until it reaches a point to where an avalanche (a drastic change of
		events) must occur for the physical system to maintain equilibrium.
		A forest fire is another good example, where a forest gradually grows in
		size until the chance of a strike of lightning hitting a tree in the area
		becomes probable. Once lighting successfully strikes, the result will be a
		fire spreading throughout the forest and burning a large chain of trees.
	</p>
	<p class="paraOutline">
		SPFFH stands for Sand Pile Forest Fire Hybrid, and vizualizes a fusion
		of the two models. It takes the aspect on analog value as represented in the
		 depth of a sandpile, and a critical point resulting in the instant change between
		a node being dead or alive as represented in the forest fire model. After
		making these changes it presents a new model that makes use of the rules
		that are present within self-organized criticality.
