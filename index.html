		<p>I am a professional shiba inu farmer. </p>

                <h2>My inventory is very expansive</h2>

                <p>I currently have a farm with a population of over 300,000 shiba inus, and the numbers are increasing exponentially.</p>

                <p>However, I am primarily a programmer, farming shiba inus is a sescret of mine, and I am expressing my main dirty little secret here with you.</p>

                <h2>Do I enjoy my farm life?</h2>

		<p>No, the population is increasing rapidly and I can no longer supply them with food, and I am afraid they will soon raid my house and eat my entire family.

      <p> At least I will die by being eaten by super cute creatures. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsXP8qeFF6A&t=30s">Monkey Vs Human</a>, that is if they don't obtain superior intelligence like the monkeys in this video.</p>

                <h2>A more positive description of my hobbies:</h2>
                <ol>
		              <li>I love playing video games such as PUBG, Resident Evil, and League of Legends.</li>
                  <li>I love learning about complex algorithms.</li>
                  <li>I love shiba inus despite what is going on in my life currently.</li>
                  <li>I love creating music and playing musical instruments.</li>
                  <li>And I love learning about History.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Oh yea, here is a picture of one of my soon-to-be human-eating dogs:</p>
